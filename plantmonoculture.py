This is a python planting algorithm which grabs the data about a certain plant and shows an optimal monoculture plot of that plant.
You can also use it directly as a Python module in your code.

usage:

 $ python plantmonoculture.py "carrot"

sample output:
graphical display of hexagons with scale.


notes: this does not have any complex algorithmic optimisation, just data -> graph
