This is a python planting algorithm which tgrabs the data about two types of plant and shows an optimal biculture plot of those plants.
You can also use it directly as a Python module in your code.

usage:

 $ python plantbiculture.py "carrot,0.3,cabbage,0.7"

sample output:
graphical display of hexagons with scale.

notes: this uses a simple algorithm for optimisation, data -> modifiers -> graph
